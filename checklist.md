[ ] Stretch Goals: A Haiku
  [ ] the haiku lived here
  [ ] it no longer amused me
  [ ] so i changed it pal

  [ ] Saturday night sign off
    [ ] Form needs Genres to register on submission
      [ ] Submission probably doesn't entirely work yet
      [ ] It's certainly not hitting the db
    [ ] Details is not displaying Genres
      [ ] where does that work get done
      [ ] i want to do it here in a function
      [ ] they probably wanted in done in a join table
      [ ] i'd really rather do it here in a function
      [ ] i have the movie id and the entire genre list
      [ ] quickest way out of here might be piping in the movies_genres table and just chopping it up in a function
      [ ] anything to avoid sql folks
      [ ] i don't even mind sql
      [ ] it's honestly so pleasant with its simplicity and absolutely unforgiving syntax
